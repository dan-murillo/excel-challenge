# Module 1 Challenge: excel-challenge
This repository contains two files:
1. An Excel workbook called "CrowdfundingBook.xlsx" that comprises the analyses of the data provided for the challenge.
2. A Word document called "Report.docx" that answers the questions "given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?", "what are some limitations of this dataset?", and "what are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?".
